# WarehouseGitpod

This project is an implementation of a study about Elixir's Fault tolerance
using supervisors and process monitors to cover processes exiting.

The base class for this implementation can be found on this youtube [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBGQBsuUvhU).

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
